#Prayer Times app for Android

This depository contains files regarding my Prayer Times app. I developed an app that displays Islamic prayer times from different online sources. Used Java’s jsoup library to retrieve and parse HTML. App also uses GPS to calculate the prayer times based on longitude and latitude. Designed app’s UI using material design. Used motion sensors and spherical geometry to detect the direction to be faced in prayer.
